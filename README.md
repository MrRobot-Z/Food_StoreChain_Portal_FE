## Dependencies

This dependencies for this project are managed using Bower using the <code>bower.json</code> file.

To let bower fetch the dependencies for us just issue command <code>bower install</code>

<b>Alternatively (if bower is not installed) we've included the CDNs for all used dependencies, just un-comment these includes in <code>index.html</code> and comment bower includes instead.</b>


## How to Run?

The Entry point for the project is <code>index.html</code>

* We can simply run <code>index.html</code> from IDE WebStorm

* We can run a server to serve us the needed pages

Note: Just opening <code>index.html</code> in browser directly is not working in the moment (working on it xD).
